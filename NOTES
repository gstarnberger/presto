BLOOM FILTER PREDICATE PUSHDOWN
 - naw temp tables - engine=memory, index(), pk
 - no, TEMP TABLES :D engine=memory, pk clustered + indices

move kafka decoder to base?
 - no, allow cross-plugin dep, recursive plugin loading
  - dag?

necessary for chunked operation:
bounded in-clause pushdown
occasional join pushdown
view inlining

connector capability enumeration
 - crud
 - complex tuple domains
  - joins, bitwise
  - nested disjuncts?

whitebox / blackbox plugins?


rbr tailing
integrate carbide ddl parser to directly modify metadata (WOW)


nested types? subtables? disjoint? untyped?


collection aggregates (windows? subselects? typed?)


presto decoder = generic connector wrapper, given a bytes col or single col
 - support for disjoints ala dot-separated column names
 - col regexes? select r(x.*)?
 - schema validation
 - + ffi = http plugin?

wrmsr-packaging? bootstrap?
 - full shading
 - JAVA_HOME

** make wrapper hierarchical poms like hadoop does, one per shaded subdep
